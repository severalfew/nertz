[Nertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerts) is a card game played by two or more people. Each person has a standard
deck of 52 playing cards. The rules are similar to solitaire, except that any aces played become a common pile on which
all players can contribute. Nertz is a speed game, all actions happen as fast as the players can play them. A game ends
when one player gets rid of every card in his hand. It is not necessary to get rid of every card in the starting piles.
Points are scored: ```+1``` for cards played into the center (on aces), ```-1``` for cards still in the hand, and 
```+0``` for cards in the starting piles in front of you.

We (Stu and Teresa) played {{ games }} games of Nertz from {{ start_date }} to {{ end_date }}. Over the course of that
time, we hosted {{ num_guests }} who were gracious enough to play Nertz with us. Don't judge them harshly, we obviously
had a **lot** more practice than they did! Let's take a deep dive into some of the interesting observations that came
out of our dataset.

Every stat that is connected to a particular player will have the same color. For example, stats for David will always
use one color. Stats for Mo will always use another. The colors for Stu and Teresa refer to the respective decks of
cards that we used most often!
